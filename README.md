# ADV_ECG
Code for Adversarial Examples in Electrocardiograms

The data is from https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/ We read it in python and saved in .npy file. 

The signals file is too large. So we provide a Google drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u10ZvEilpZnOB4ls5ZAU5ywwf9g23oiB/view?usp=sharing

Before you use the code, please download *raw_data.npy* from the link above and put it into the *data* folder.

In this folder:
-*train.py*: train the model and will save *best_model.pth* in *saved_model* folder. This training may take two days. We already provide the model we trained in the *saved_model* folder.
